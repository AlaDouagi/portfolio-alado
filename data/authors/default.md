A full-stack JavaScript developer, passionate about functional programming and Rust.

Presently, I am working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Metro Markets GmbH](https://www.metro-markets.de/) where I am helping to build the number 1 HoReCa marketplace in Europe.

Previously I've worked with several Tunisian start-ups and helped in building several MVPs.
